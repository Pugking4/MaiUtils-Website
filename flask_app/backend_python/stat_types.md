~~1. Average constant level for all charts played, only count ones which have a constant~~
~~2. Average constant level for all charts played, count charts with constant and non-constant levels. Non-constant levels are counted as x.0 and x+ levels are counted as x.7~~

~~8. % of times I get FS, FS+, FSD and FSD+ on charts for each person I play with~~
~~9. Who failed FSD if one person got FC+ and the other got FC, who failed FSD+ if one person got AP and the other got FC+~~
