Idea #1
Create a website or tab which reads scores from maimai every hour (or set time interval) using web scraper and compiles it into days 
and displays my scores of that day or if there are non yet just display whatever the previous day was.
It should also log what day I was at kp (if I played atleast 1 game) and how many games I played, what I played and my score of said plays
Should be exclusive to me as it would require my sega ID and pass for web scraping (prob not gonna release publically)

Idea #2
Create a website or tab which calculates the rating gain when you input a level constant (eg 14.8 or 13.4) 
and then outputs the rating you would receive for each rank or if you input a score/rank it would output the rating gained from that (eg 100.1453 at 13.5)

Idea #3
Tab which you can extract all chart song information from in SQLite format or other.

Idea #4
Tab for checking completed lamps and how close each lamp is to completion (bonus to include hardest charts over set constant or default 14.0 as a seperate warning)
